            <h2>About me</h2>

            <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200" alt="Your Name">

            <p>Hello my name is Zac Warner! I grew up in Rocklin california, but in 2012 moved to Portland Oregon where
                I lived their for 6 years. Just recently I have returned to California and have been getting used to
                things like sales tax, pumping your own gas, and no plastic bags again. But the sunshine and warmer
                weather has been a great change of pace for me!</p>

            <p>I returned to college last year and took an intro cs class as an elective that focused on mostly python,
                and fell in love with coding. From that class on I knew I wanted to pursue a career somewhere in
                computer science. After a couple moves and taking as many cs courses as I could afford I discovered the
                boot camps as a better alternative that focuses exclusively on what Iâ€™m interested. Super excited to
                learn new skills and switch my career around.</p>
